All tablets were measured in the transmittance mode.  Each individual tablet was subsequently analyzed for ASSAY value, tablet weight, and tablet hardness. All log (1/T) spectra cover the region from 600 to 1898 nm in 2 nm increments.\"... \"Data from each instrument has been split into a calibration file (155 spectra), and a validation file (459 spectra). In addition, a small test file (40 spectra) from each instrument is avaliable for testing calibrations. The challenge is to develop the best possible calibration for the ASSAY value on one instrument, and to provide the best means of transferring the calibration to the other instrument. The reference method has an error of +/- 1.3 mg on these tablets with a nominal value of 200 mg per tablet. The data set includes tablets with a wide ASSAY range, 152 to 239 mg, for developing calibration(s). No deliberate outliers are included in the data set, but there may be outliers due to experimental errors. The name of the active ingredient in these tablets can not be disclosed for proprietary reasons.\"",
